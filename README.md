- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.

- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.
- Bikes are mostly checked out for 4 to 6 hours.
- Male users take approximately 3 times more rides than the female users.

- Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
- Those rides are mostly taken by male users.

## Summary
The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019.\
The far majority of the rides were occuring at a busy frequency within Manhattan, and taken by "He/Him" riders during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as a solid alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.\
Additional analysis would be beneficial by :
- gathering and comparing data from a 12 month span to determine trends across the year. 
- gathering and intergrating weather data to our analysis, and compare weather to rides.
